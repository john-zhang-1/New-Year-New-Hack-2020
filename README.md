Project aimed at helping users find the ideal conditions for sleep quality with machine learning.

After creating a user, enter in data and train the model with the user.train() method. Use the predict method or the message method to show what a predicted sleep will be like, and how the user can improve their sleep conditions.

Hyperparameter tuning is currently being implemented to extract the best features for sleeping easily.
